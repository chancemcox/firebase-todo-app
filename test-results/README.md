- **`github-actions-comprehensive-summary.md`** - Detailed workflow results

## Configuration

### **Playwright Configuration**
- **Output Directory**: `./test-results/playwright-output`
- **Screenshots**: Saved on test failure
- **Videos**: Retained on test failure
- **Traces**: Generated on first retry
- **Reports**: HTML, JUnit XML, and JSON formats

### **Jest Configuration**
- **Coverage Directory**: `./test-results/coverage`
- **Coverage Formats**: HTML, LCOV, Clover XML, JSON
- **Test Results**: Detailed test execution information

## Usage

### **Local Development**
```bash
# Unit tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Organized test runs (with file organization)
npm run test:organize          # Unix/Linux/macOS
npm run test:organize:win      # Windows
```

### **GitHub Actions**
- **Automatic**: Runs on push/PR to main/develop branches
- **Manual**: Can be triggered manually through GitHub UI
- **Artifacts**: All results automatically uploaded and organized
- **Integration**: Seamlessly works with local test-results structure

### **Viewing Results**
- **Coverage Reports**: Open `test-results/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`
- **Playwright Reports**: Open `test-results/playwright-report/index.html`
- **Test Artifacts**: Check `test-results/playwright-output/` for screenshots and videos
- **GitHub Actions**: Check `test-results/github-actions-*.md` for workflow summaries

## File Organization

All test outputs are automatically organized into the appropriate subdirectories:
- **Screenshots**: `playwright-output/` or root of test-results
- **Coverage**: `coverage/` directory
- **Reports**: Various report formats in root and subdirectories
- **Artifacts**: Test-specific files in dedicated folders

## Integration Features

### **Local Scripts**
- **`scripts/run-playwright-tests.sh`** - Unix/Linux/macOS automation
- **`scripts/run-playwright-tests.bat`** - Windows automation
- **Automatic file organization** and cleanup

### **GitHub Actions**
- **`playwright-tests.yml`** - E2E test automation
- **`full-test-suite.yml`** - Comprehensive testing workflow
- **Automatic artifact management** and organization

## Note

- Test files are regenerated on each run
- Large files (PNG, MP4, WebM) are ignored in git to prevent repository bloat
- Folder structure is tracked in git for organization
- All test outputs are centralized here for easier debugging and analysis
- GitHub Actions automatically maintains the same folder structure as local development
