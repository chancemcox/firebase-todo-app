# Background Agent Tasks - Firebase Todo App Login Fix

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
1. **Diagnosed login issue**: Firebase hosting MIME type error due to misconfigured routing
2. **Fixed Firebase configuration**: Updated `firebase.json` to serve from `dist` directory instead of `public`
3. **Updated Login component**: Fixed domain reference to `todo.cox-fam.com`
4. **Created Playwright verification tests**: `tests/e2e/login-fix-verification.spec.js`
5. **Rebuilt application**: Successfully built with corrected configuration

## üîÑ Remaining Tasks for Background Agent

### Immediate Actions Needed:
1. **Complete Playwright setup**:
   ```bash
   nvm use lts/*  # v22.16.0
   npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
   npx playwright install
   npx playwright test tests/e2e/login-fix-verification.spec.js
   ```

2. **Deploy fixed version**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

3. **Add custom domain to Firebase authorized domains**:
   - Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/todo-list-e7788/authentication/settings
   - Navigate to Authentication ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Authorized domains
   - Add: `todo.cox-fam.com`
   - Verify existing domains: `localhost`, `todo-list-e7788.web.app`

4. **Verify production fix**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://todo.cox-fam.com/login
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://todo-list-e7788.web.app/login
   ```

5. **Run production verification tests**:
   - Test login page loads without JavaScript MIME errors
   - Test Firebase authentication domain authorization
   - Verify no browser extension conflicts affect functionality

## üéØ Expected Outcomes
- Login page loads correctly on both `todo-list-e7788.web.app` and `todo.cox-fam.com`
- No JavaScript module MIME type errors
- Firebase authentication works with custom domain
- All Playwright tests pass

## üîç Issues Fixed
- **Main Issue**: `Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html"`
- **Root Cause**: Firebase hosting was serving from `public/` directory but app builds to `dist/`
- **Resolution**: Updated `firebase.json` to serve from correct directory with proper SPA routing

## üìã Current Status
- ‚úÖ Node.js: v22.16.0 (LTS)
- ‚úÖ Firebase project: `todo` alias (todo-list-e7788)
- ‚úÖ App built successfully
- ‚è≥ Playwright tests ready to run
- ‚è≥ Deployment pending
- ‚è≥ Domain authorization pending

## üé® Landing Page Integration
The beautiful landing page at `public/index.html` needs to be integrated into the React app routing for a complete user experience. Consider creating a Landing component for the root route.

## üîß Environment
```
Node.js: v22.16.0
npm: v10.9.2
Firebase CLI: Ready
Playwright: @playwright/test installed
Build output: dist/ directory
```

**Background agent should prioritize completing the deployment and domain authorization steps first, then run verification tests.**
