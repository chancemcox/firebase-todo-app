# Logs Directory

This directory contains all log files generated by the application's testing, building, and development processes.

## Log Files

- **test-output.log** - Jest unit test execution logs
- **coverage-output.log** - Test coverage report logs
- **build-output.log** - Build process logs
- **lint-output.log** - ESLint linting logs
- **lint-fix-output.log** - ESLint auto-fix logs
- **playwright-output.log** - Playwright end-to-end test logs

## Purpose

All application logs are centralized here for easier debugging and monitoring. The logs folder structure is tracked in git, but individual log files are ignored to prevent committing large log files.

## Usage

Logs are automatically generated when running:
- `npm test` - Generates test-output.log
- `npm run test:coverage` - Generates coverage-output.log
- `npm run test:e2e` - Generates playwright-output.log
- `npm run lint` - Generates lint-output.log
- `npm run lint:fix` - Generates lint-fix-output.log

## Note

Log files are regenerated on each run, so they always contain the most recent execution results.
